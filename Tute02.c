/*Exercise 2 - Selection

Write a program to calculate the amount to be paid for a rented vehicle.

•	Input the distance the van has travelled
•	The first 30 km is at a rate of 50/= per km.
•	The remaining distance is calculated at the rate of 40/= per km.


e.g.

Distance -> 20
Amount = 20 x 50 = 1000


Distance -> 50
Amount = 30 x 50 + (50-30) x 40 = 2300*/
